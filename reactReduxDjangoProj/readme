  1. . bin/activate (corresponding: deactivate - no bin) (~/Projects/reactReduxDjangoEnv)
  2. npm build/watch
     - 'npm run build' build dev main.js, then localhost can run with this main.js
     - 'npm run build:watch' build and watch dev main.js if source file changed, refresh browser to reflect new change
     - 'npm start -s' with node backend running, hot-reloading new change (when switching between 2 and 3, a build is needed)
  3. python manage.py runserver (~/Projects/reactReduxDjangoEnv/reactReduxDjangoProj)

- npm run build-prod: build prod dist/main-[#hash].js (not fully walking thru yet)

- ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.dev.babel.js

- Hot reloading
  * http://owaislone.org/blog/webpack-plus-reactjs-and-django/
  * webpack-dev-server react-hot-loader two packages for hot-reload
  * in console [HMR]: hot module replacement, [WDS]: webpack-dev-server
  * https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr (React Hot Loader 3 is the solution, not fully ready yet. Currently babel-preset-react-hmre is the solution: Make sure you process files with babel-loader, and that you don’t use React Hot Loader (it’s not needed with this transform)
  * babel-preset-react-hmre
    1. Experimental,
    2. doesn't reload functional components
    3. doesn't reload container functions like mapStateToProps.
    4. React Hot Loader 3 is in beta, it addresses these downsides. It will be the recommended approach when released.

- babel-polyfill 50k

- babel-register package is for building webpack.config.*.babel.js, webpack.config.dev.hot.js doesn't need this becasue it use babel-node

- react-router-dom: new react-router (> Version 4), new logic order is, index->app->routes
